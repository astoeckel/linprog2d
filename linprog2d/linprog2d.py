    Solves the given two-dimensional linear programming problem.

    Parameters
    ==========

    cx: x-component of the gradient vector
    cy: y-component of the gradient vector
    Gx: is an n-element vector containing the x-components of the constraint
        normal vectors, where n is the number of constraints.
    Gy: is an n-element vector containing the y-components of the constraint
        normal vectors, where n is the number of constraints.
    h: is an n-element vector containing the offsets of the constraint vectors.

    Return
    ======

    A linprog2d_result structure containing the following fields:

    x1, y1, x2, y2:
       The result is encoded as two points. If the optimum is a single point,
       this point is stored as (x1, y1). Otherwise, if the optimum lies on an
       edge, the result is encoded in the pair (x1, y1), (x2, y2).

        these numeric constants for more information.
